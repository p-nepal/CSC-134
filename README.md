CSC-134: C++ Programming Coursework

This repository contains my classwork for CSC-134: C++ Programming, where I learned key programming concepts through a series of assignments and exercises. Below is a brief overview of each module:
ðŸ“š Modules Overview
1. Introduction to C++

This module focused on the basic syntax of C++, including how to set up and run a C++ program. We covered:

    The structure of a C++ program

    Compiling and running C++ programs

    The main() function

    Output statements like cout and cin

2. Variables and Data Types

In this section, we explored different data types in C++ and how to use them in programming. Key topics included:

    Declaring variables and constants

    Understanding and using int, float, char, double, bool

    Type conversion and type casting

3. Control Structures

This module introduced conditional statements and loops:

    Using if, else if, and switch to control program flow

    Writing simple programs to implement decision-making

    Looping with for, while, and do-while

4. Functions

Functions were the focus of this module, and we covered:

    Writing and defining functions

    Passing arguments by value and by reference

    Function overloading and recursion

5. Arrays and Vectors

Arrays and vectors were introduced as ways to store collections of data:

    Working with arrays and multidimensional arrays

    Using STL (Standard Template Library) vectors

    Sorting and searching within arrays

6. Pointers and Memory Management

This module focused on dynamic memory management and pointer operations:

    Using pointers to reference variables

    Allocating and freeing memory with new and delete

    Working with arrays and pointers

7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP principles were explored in this module, including:

    Classes, objects, and constructors

    Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

    Overloading operators and using member functions

8. File Input/Output (I/O)

In this section, we learned how to handle files in C++:

    Reading from and writing to text files using file streams (ifstream, ofstream)

    Manipulating file data in various formats

ðŸ“Œ How to Use This Repository

To explore any of the assignments:

    Clone the repository or download the desired file.

    Compile the .cpp file using a C++ compiler like g++.

    Run the executable to see the results.
